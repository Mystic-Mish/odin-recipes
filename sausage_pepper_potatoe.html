    <p>This sausage and potato bake is an Italian comfort food classic! The smell of this cooking in my kitchen
        transports me back to playing on the street in front of my Papa and Gigi's house in Brooklyn. I make 2 trays of
        this for every family get-together, and it's gone in a flash!</p>

        <li>Cook the Sausage, Potatoes, Peppers, and Onions
